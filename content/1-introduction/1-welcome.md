## What should you know?

To walk through the steps and understand the workflow, you won't need much 
specific knowledge. However, in order to get the most out of the example code, 
you'll need a basic understanding of [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/). A 
background in configuration of [Nginx](http://wiki.nginx.org/Main) or other 
server components is optional.

## System requirements

For the code examples to run on your machine you will need:

1.  The examples assume a *nix terminal. Windows might work, but you are on your 
own.
1.  [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) >= 1.9.3 suggested

1.  [Bundler](http://gembundler.com/)
